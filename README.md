Thank you for desiring to continue the ancient game of Mancala for another generation!

This program allows the user to play a virtualized version of the popular board game of Mancala. After choosing whether to play against a human or computer opponent, 
the user should click on one of their pits to move marbles into their store. The goal of the game is to have more marbles in your store than your opponenet by the end 
of the game.

In order to begin the program, 'image' and 'src' directories should be installed at the same level within the parent package. The program is then started by running
the Controller.java file. This will initiate the program to your playing pleasure.

Enjoy playing Mancala!
